Max and Gabriel: Worked on all code pushed by either Max or Gabriel together. Designed some of the initial UI/screens. Reformatted original purple screens to have orange gradient, be more consistent, and have a more professional look. Designed backend algorithm to randomly pair each participant with another random participant every round of the event; algorithm designed to prevent repeat pairings across rounds and eventually produce all possible pairs. Implemented NFC to save connections while paired during an event. Also implemented button alternative to NFC for non NFC-compatible devices (next to chat button). Designed and implemented splash screen when app is opened and "how to use Social.ly" screen. NOTE: we have very few commits to the main branch of the repository because Android Studio runs very slowly (if at all) on our laptops; groupmates ensured our code functioned properly and push to main instead. Most of our commits are to other branches.
